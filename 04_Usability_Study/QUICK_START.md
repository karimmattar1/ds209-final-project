## 🎤 During Tasks - Say These Things

When participant is doing tasks:

✅ **SAY:**
- "What are you thinking right now?"
- "What are you looking for?"
- "Tell me what you see"
- "Keep thinking out loud"
- "Interesting - tell me more about that"

❌ **DON'T SAY:**
- "Click here" (don't help!)
- "That's wrong" (don't judge!)
- "I designed it that way because..." (don't defend!)
- "Most people figured this out" (don't make them feel bad!)

---

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Helping too quickly** → Let them struggle for 1-2 minutes first
2. **Not recording** → Double check recording is ON
3. **Forgetting think-aloud** → Remind them to talk as they work
4. **Waiting too long to write notes** → Do it within 24 hours!
5. **Not using exact task wording** → Read tasks directly from the plan

---

## 📊 After All 3 Sessions - Create Final Report

### Step 1: List All Issues
Combine notes from all 3 participants. List every problem.

### Step 2: Count Frequency
- How many participants had this issue?
- 3/3 = Critical
- 2/3 = Important
- 1/3 = Consider

### Step 3: Categorize with MoSCoW

**MUST Fix:**
- Blocker issues (prevented task completion)
- Seen in 2-3 participants

**SHOULD Fix:**
- Major issues (made task very hard)
- Seen in 2-3 participants

**COULD Fix:**
- Minor issues
- Seen in 1 participant

**WON'T Fix:**
- Out of scope for this project

### Step 4: Write Solutions
For each MUST and SHOULD fix, write:
- **Problem:** What went wrong
- **Impact:** Why it matters
- **Solution:** How you'll fix it

---

## 📝 What You'll Submit

**ONE document containing:**

1. **Task List** (copy from plan)
2. **3 Participant Notes** (completed templates)
3. **Prioritized Findings** (MoSCoW format with solutions)

**Rubric Reminder:**
- Appropriateness of tasks: 20 pts
- Thoroughness: 20 pts
- Attention to what users do: 20 pts
- Accurate prioritization: 20 pts
- Observations → Solutions correlation: 20 pts

---

## 🎯 Success Looks Like

✅ You completed 3 sessions
✅ You have recordings of all 3
✅ You wrote notes within 24 hours of each session
✅ You identified at least 5-10 issues across participants
✅ You prioritized them using MoSCoW
✅ You have concrete solutions for MUST/SHOULD fixes
✅ Your observations directly support your solutions

## ⚡ Fast Track Schedule

**Week 1:**
- Mon: Recruit participants, schedule sessions
- Tue: Session 1 → Write notes same day
- Wed: Session 2 → Write notes same day

---

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

**Participant goes silent:**
→ Ask "What are you thinking?"

**Participant asks for help:**
→ Say "What would you try first?"

**Task takes too long (>5 min):**
→ Give hint from plan, note they needed help

**Participant finds a bug:**
→ Great! Note it as critical issue

**Recording fails:**
→ Take detailed notes by hand, apologize, offer to redo session

**Participant completes tasks too easily:**
→ Good! Note what worked well in debriefing
