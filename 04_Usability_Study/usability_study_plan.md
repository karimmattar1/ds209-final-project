## Session Script

### Introduction (2 minutes)

**Say this to participants:**

> "Thank you for participating in this usability study. I'm testing a football player analysis tool I built for my Data Visualization class at UC Berkeley.
>
> This session will take about 30 minutes. I'll ask you to complete some tasks while I observe. Please think aloud as you work - tell me what you're thinking, what you're looking for, and if anything confuses you.
>
> Remember: I'm testing the website, not you. There are no wrong answers. If something doesn't work, that's valuable feedback for me. Feel free to be honest about what you like and don't like.
>
> I'll be recording your screen and audio for my analysis. Is that okay with you?"

**Wait for consent, then start recording.**

> "Great! I'm going to share the website link with you now: https://karimmattar1.github.io/ds209-final-project/06_Website/
>
> Please open it and take a moment to look at the homepage. Don't click anything yet - just tell me your first impressions."

**Note their initial reaction (confused? excited? understanding the purpose?)**

## After All 3 Sessions: Prioritize Findings

### Step 1: Compile All Issues

List every issue observed across all 3 participants:

Example:
- User couldn't find Compare page (2 participants)
- Didn't understand what "xG" means (3 participants)
- Search box was hard to find (1 participant)
- Charts took long to load (2 participants)
- Loved the interactive tooltips (3 participants)

### Step 2: Count Frequency

Note how many participants experienced each issue:
- 3 participants = Critical
- 2 participants = Important
- 1 participant = Consider

### Step 3: Assess Severity

For each issue, rate severity:
- **Blocker:** Prevents task completion
- **Major:** Makes task very difficult
- **Minor:** Annoying but doesn't prevent completion
- **Cosmetic:** Visual only, doesn't affect usability

### Step 4: Apply MoSCoW Prioritization

Categorize each finding:

**MUST Fix (Critical Issues)**
- Frequency: 2-3 participants
- Severity: Blocker or Major
- Example: "Users can't find navigation menu" or "Search doesn't work"

**SHOULD Fix (Important Issues)**
- Frequency: 2-3 participants
- Severity: Minor
- OR Frequency: 1 participant, Severity: Major
- Example: "Unclear metric definitions" or "Slow loading charts"

**COULD Fix (Nice to Have)**
- Frequency: 1 participant
- Severity: Minor or Cosmetic
- Example: "Would like darker color scheme"

**WON'T Fix (Out of Scope)**
- Too complex for current timeline
- Doesn't align with project goals
- Example: "Add video highlights of players"

### Step 5: Create Prioritized List

Format:

```
MUST FIX
1. [Issue] - Observed in X/3 participants
   Problem: [Describe what happened]
   Impact: [Why it matters]
   Solution: [How to fix it]

2. [Issue] - Observed in X/3 participants
   Problem:
   Impact:
   Solution:

SHOULD FIX
[Same format]

COULD FIX
[Same format]

WON'T FIX
[Same format with explanation]
```
